My 9-year-old son and I read newspaper articles together from time to time.

It's fairly fun and educational, because grown-up articles...

*   ... are often about real and fairly exciting things,
*   ... use serious, grown-up language,
*   ... assume a lot of background knowledge that kids generally don't have.

I'd like to talk about this for a bit, because I think there are strong parallels between this process and more-general experiences of learning complex new material, for example when people are first learning how to program a computer.

  
So, today we read this one from the New York Times:  

<div style="float:left;border:1px solid black">

## Our typical attack plan

Here's what Isaac and I normally do when we approach an article:

*   Read the title
*   Read the lede paragraph
*   Go back to the title and make sure we understand what each key word or phrase means 
    *   Check the definitions of harder words
    *   Check whether we're picking up the gist of shorter words that represent other, complex things
*   Do the same thing for the words in the lede
*   Read on for one or two more paragraphs, without sweating the details as much
*   Try to summarize what the article was about
*   Briefly discuss what we think about the article

  


## How it went this time

Here's what we wound up touching on when we went through this article:

#### Title

"As Cost of <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">Importing</span> Food <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">Soars</span>, <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">Jamaica</span> Turns to the <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">Earth</span>"

#### Lede
"…as the country’s food imports have become a billion-dollar threat to <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">finances</span> and health, Jamaica has taken on a bold new strategy: make farming <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">patriotic</span>"

#### Body

"In a region where farming is still often seen as a reminder of <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">plantations</span> and <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">slavery</span>, the <span style="font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;color:green">challenge runs deep</span>…"

It took about 40 minutes to go through these side explorations.

## Retrospective
      
Each time we read an article in this "concept map" kind of way, I am struck by just how much backstory and context is required in order to understand even a handful of words in a single headline.
      
I notice there are a bunch of different categories of comprehension-blockers:
      
* Not knowing the basic definition of a word
* Not knowing some key background concepts
* Not knowing some specific background facts
* Not knowing why a word is being used in a specific spot
* Not knowing what connects to what, <em>within</em> a sentence
* Not knowing what connects to what, <em>between</em> sentences
* Not knowing what connects to what, between paragraphs
* Not being able to discern the outline of the argument
* Not understanding the overall gist of the piece -- why are they writing this?
* Not knowing how the material applies to other contexts
      
Basically, there are several layers to reading, and if you fail at any level, you will fall off the pyramid of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_Taxonomy#Cognitive">Bloom's Taxonomy</a> at some point, before you get to actually using this new knowledge:

It isn't just children who face this challenge, naturally, adult second-language learners who are unfamiliar with popular culture, current events, etc of their target country also have a lot of difficulty parsing stuff like this.
      
And going beyond the act of reading newspaper articles and whatnot, as I mentioned earlier, I think there are analogies to be drawn to all sorts of learning/comprehension challenges that people of all ages face, not just people learning how to read newspaper articles.
      
Specifically, reading computer code is very similar, in fact. I'd like to explore that in an upcoming post.
