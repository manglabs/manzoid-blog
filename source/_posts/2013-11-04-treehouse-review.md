[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) is a popular site for learning website and app development.

It can be a little hard to tell with these paywalled learning sites whether it's worth investing in a subscription. You can try the freebie content, but that doesn't necessarily give you a full view of what you'd get if you got past the paywall.

So to save you the trouble in Treehouse's case, I got a trial subscription myself and whipped up a little overview of their Rails development "learning trail" for you.

The first thing to figure out is just what topics they cover, over how many hours of video playtime.

### Production Quality

I only poked around here and there to get a sampling, but in general the production quality was high. There are nicely-designed graphic aids embedded in the videos, the preparation and pacing by the presenters is reasonable, and they provide decent interactive exercises for review.

In general, the presentation attempts to be fun, but isn't really all that fun.

### Curriculum

The material is served up broad and shallow. Lots of topics, not much detail about any one thing. Just a quick taste of what's there, then move on.

There are some noticeable flaws. It looks like Treehouse has assembled these "trails" from chunks of content that were produced originally for other contexts. When they're assembled in a "trail", the treatment can feel kind of uneven.

For example, the CSS-related stuff was kind of a hodgepodge, and way too long (you can see how much of an outlier it is, in terms of total video time, in the table above). It also contains a number of CSS things that are still experimental, and won't work widely, and some other things which are seldom-used curiosities, like using CSS to capitalize English text.

I feel like from time to time they wandered away somewhat from the practical task of building a website, and threw in a bunch of stuff of nice-to-have material that winds up as clutter.

### Time commitment

Going through all this material as a beginner or near-beginner, giving yourself some margin to be able to rewind and review as necessary, and working through all the quizzes and exercises, I estimate would take a beginner **upwards of 100 hours**. That will vary of course depending on individual, but there is a lot of material here. Just watching the videos once will take 40 hours.

So that given, I think this is a 2- or 3-month commitment of calendar time, at $25/month.


### tl;dr conclusion

Subscribe to [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) instead!

I know, that's a little weird, given that I just spent this whole post describing Treehouse. But the Code School videos are even slicker, the framing of lessons is more fun and varied, the interactive exercises are better, and frankly the owner-guy/head-instructor-dude Gregg Pollack seems like a better teacher and comes across more natural / less stilted than the Treehouse presenters. 

But don't just take my word for it. Both sites have 30-day money-back guarantees, so I'd say just sign up for them both and see for yourself.
