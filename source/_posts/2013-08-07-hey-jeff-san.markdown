My friend Jeff was doing some business at his company's Tokyo office recently, and asked me how to interpret the "-san" thing. He was wondering if he was being explicitly honored when he was called "Jeff-san".

I told him, "Yes, they are revering you and all your ancestors."

Then I said, "Just kidding."

The tl;dr version is that that "Jeff-san" usage is completely normal and common, and as far as you should be *practically* concerned, it means nothing more than someone calling you "Jeff".

However, there *is* more to it than that. And anyone who knows me, knows that I won't just leave it at that. Why use 30 words when 3,000 will do?

So let's unpack more of the nuances.

### "Come on, Masaro!"

Setting aside for a moment the *gaijin* (foreigner) scenario that Jeff is concerned with, if two Japanese natives are talking to each other, then one calling the other by their first name alone (as in "Come on, Masaro, that's crazy talk.") certainly does occur at times, but it has a really intimate feel to it. It signals the implication that you are very close -- you are Masaro's parent, or you two were close in college and have known each other for 20 years and are just talking by yourselves (not in front of others who don't share that status). In those cases, using someone's first name feels natural.

But outside of such intimate situations, it sounds very **naked and weird** to use somebody's first name as-is. Sometimes *gaijin* will do this in an earnest attempt to be friendly, and it's quite jarring to hear.

### "Jeff-san, when are you free?"

In a normal Japanese office situation (actually in most social situations outside of the office as well), the last name (e.g., "Suzuki-san") is a lot more common to use than the first name. There are always special, context-sensitive exceptions, where you might say "Masaro-san" at work, but the general rule would be "Suzuki-san".

However, that's the pure-Japanese case. For *gaishikei* (foreign subsidiaries in Japan), Japanese employees find themselves, by definition, in a mixed-culture setting. The foreigners, speaking English, will all be addressing each other casually by first name, i.e, "Hi Jeff, when are you free to meet?"

However, a native Japanese guy would not by default say that, as it would feel wrong, to the point of quasi-rudeness. But on the other hand, since everyone else is so casual, it also sounds stand-offish, overly stiff, and potentially off-putting to refer to your foreign co-workers, with whom you are working and going to lunch with on a daily basis, exclusively by their last names.

"Ah, yes, Mansfield-san!" << dorky

These *gaishikei* Japanese teammates don't want to exude *too much* of a sheen of exoticism, if they can help it. Japanese people already operate under the baggage of a lot of overblown stereotypes of them as an alien culture:

*   they're like **ants** in an **ant colony**!
*   they have no **imagination**, they can only **copy**!
*   they are like **samurai**, they are willing to sacrifice their very **lives** for the collective!

… yadda yadda.

Obviously Japanese in real life are not like these stereotypical extremes, and in fact, the Japanese you'd be likely to meet in a professional setting are going to be pretty worldly. They're conscious of these lame memes, and want to avoid triggering them, so they'll generally go with the "Jeff-san" approach, or if they feel especially confident that they can fit in and pull it off, some Japanese guys will just run with "Jeff" like the other *gaijin*. It's hard to escape that awkward tang of over-familiarity with plain "Jeff", however, so that's definitely not the norm.

### Subtle pride

Stepping back, Japanese are a very proud and stubborn people, with a sense of national exceptionalism that is as *at least* deep as any other country, including the United States. Given this backstory, my impression is that they don't necessarily want to completely accommodate their foreign counterparts, either.

I believe this is another reason to call you "Jeff-san" rather than just the completely-Western-style "Jeff". The "Jeff-san" thing, in other words, is a compromise between their ingrained sensibilities of what's appropriate and their ingrained desire for harmonious daily interaction and relationship-building with foreigners they need to work with -- while at the same time retaining the flavor of their own culture. While it's compromise, it's compromise in the end struck largely on their own terms.

It's important to note, in this connection, that using names like "Tim-san" and "Jeff-san" sounds very faintly... well, "childish" is not quite the right term, but it's still a tiny bit *over-familiar*, shall we say.

My sense is that on some proud, almost subconscious level, this "Jeff-san" usage is often deployed as a subtle way of putting foreigners in their place, within a distinctly Japanese hierarchy. This process is completely invisible to the foreigners themselves because they are focused on the "-san" part, thinking it is placing them on a bit of a pedestal. But the "-san" suffix means basically nothing in itself, in terms of being an honorific, rather it's just a marker of polite tone-of-speech. So it's got the built-in irony of seeming to honor the person in question without actually doing so in any real way, which I'm sure you recognize as a theme in East Asian negotiation style.
