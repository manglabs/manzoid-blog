I ran across a cool paper called "[The Mundanity of Excellence](http://manzoid.com/static/mundanity_of_excellence.pdf)". It's only 18 pages long, an easy read as academic material goes, and gives lots of concrete examples from a somewhat interesting domain (competitive swimming). Give it a whirl.

## Summary of the Mundanity of Excellence

1. **Talent is way over-rated**. What we call "talent" is often a post-facto observation of excellent results, muddling correlation with causation.

2. Magical performances are made up of a lot of **mundane little pieces**, each comparatively straightforward to pick up. (Not easy, necessarily, but not at all impossible for "mere mortals")

3. From very early on, **top-class performers do completely different things, within completely different circles**, than average performers. It's not like there is a giant ladder from "beginner" to "Olympic". Instead, there are a bunch of completely different ladders.

4. People don't become world-class just by being intense, working 10 times as hard as ordinary people. Top performers do work hard, of course, but not as hard as you might think.

So, in sum, a lot more people have the capacity for excellence than is commonly believed. 

## Your folk beliefs about excellence are holding you down

Let's invert these points to illustrate the mistaken beliefs we tend to fall into:

1. Some people are born with great talent. **I'm not born with great talent, so there's no point in trying**.

2. Magical performances are the result of great talent. **I could never do that. So I'm not going try.**

3. To try to get up to that next level, **I will do more of the same-old, average things I've been doing**.

4. Great performers get that way in part by working extremely hard. **I can't/won't work that hard, so I'm not going to try.**

You can clearly see that these points embody a dead-end point of view.

## What you can do instead

1. Study top performers in your field. Figure out what they are doing, and who they are doing it with.

2. Make sure your goals and activity areas are aligned with what top performers are doing. Don't settle for what a "weekend warrior" or "local league player" would do, if your actual aim is "top professional player".[^1]

3. Work smart first, *then* work hard. That means focusing consciously on doing things that lead to mastery, not just wandering in the woods of diletantte-ism or "i gotta do this cuz it's what most people are doing around me, it's what's expected of me", etc.

4. Break down top-level performance into a bunch of smaller, more "mundane" skills.[^2]

5. Practice these skills steadily, one after another, having the "mundane" discipline to show up to work every day.

6. Muster the guts to perform, to deliver something, even if you absolutely and excruciatingly *know* it's going to be crap at first. Putting stuff out there, putting yourself out there, is the only real way to engage the community, so you can grow.


## Easier said than done

I know all this stuff falls, with the rustle and thud of an overstuffed garbage bag, squarely into the realm of "easier said than done". It's really hard to follow this kind of path alone.

So, find your people! Nobody makes it to the Olympics by themselves. Even world-class artists still had teachers, early on. Later, they joined or created a community of other excellent artists to collaborate with, to observe and critique, and to compete with (think of competition as an active kind of observation and feedback).

Find mentors and coaches, find a community. Figure out what your target community of excellent performers is doing, and how they got there -- and start taking steps down the road to where they are.

Remember, the key word in all this is "mundanity". There are lot of small steps you can take, each one do-able in itself. Figuring out what those steps are is probably going to be a collaborative process, but it's a process that *you* can initiate and steerâ€¦ if you believe that it's worth even trying.

## Don't give up on yourself!

^^ That.

[^1]: But of course, if "recreational player" or "decent semi-pro" is your goal, that's totally OK. Just embrace that goal consciously...
[^2]: This is why even world-class athletes still have coaches -- decomposing complex performance into its constituent skills isn't always easy to do yourself. But however you do it, it is probably mandatory in order for you to get anywhere.
