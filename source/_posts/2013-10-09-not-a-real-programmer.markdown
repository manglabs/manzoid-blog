As I talk to people who are learning to code, I keep running into misunderstandings about who "computer programmers" are, usually in the context of "Well shucks, I'm not a brainiac like those **real** programmers…".

### False premises about being a programmer

* You need a computer science degree. 
* You need an engineering or science degree.
* You need to have gone to Stanford, MIT, etc.
* You need to have gone to college at all.
	* (Or at least be some dropout-genius like Bill Gates)
* You need to have gotten straight-A's in school.
* You need to be "good at math".
* You need to be a super-brain.
* You need to display stereotypical nerd-trappings.
	* You have a thick neck-beard.
	* You play "Magic: The Gathering".
	* You know everything about every episode in every series in the canonical Star Trek universe.
	* You build robots in your spare time.
	* You juggle
		* … at [Ren Faires](http://www.renfair.com/).
	* Etc.

There are grains of truth here, of course. Sure, people who went to MIT and majored in Computer Science are going to be pretty smart in general, and have specific, relevant training. But the good news is that you don't have to be Spock to make a dent in the world.

Plenty of normal people with normal intelligence are able to cut reasonable code. It is a learnable mindset and set of skills. A lot of what's involved is just patience and perseverance necessary to pick up the patterns and lingo, and to learn how to construct things carefully and tidily enough that you don't just make a big mess and confuse yourself.

You probably won't be re-building Google Maps or inventing your own programming language anytime soon, but that still leaves open a huge universe of do-able, useful apps that are within your grasp.

You just have to start, and stick with it.

### "Do or do not, there is no be"

I knew a guy in college who wore a black turtleneck literally every day. He was very self-conscious about what writers supposedly looked like and what they supposedly did and how they acted. He was constantly moaning and/or crowing about how he wanted to be a writer.

But you don't "be a writer" -- you write. Writing is what makes you a writer.

So -- aspiring coders -- please don't drive yourself crazy with half-baked notions about some externally-imposed bar you need to pass before you can think of yourself as a "programmer".  If you program, you're a programmer.

When I was a younger dude, I thought that "college student" meant a person going to a 4-year college, and only that. I vaguely knew that there were other kinds of colleges but I dismissed them as not being a "real" college experience. That, of course, is B.S. There are 2-year colleges, there are people going part-time, taking several years to earn their degree, there are all sorts of specialized programs, adult/professional learners, [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) and many other online things nowadays, and whatnot.

Similarly, there are many flavors of programmer, all legitimate. You don't have to be a professional, you can be a hobbyist. Plenty of useful software is made by hobbyists.

Or you can be a professional, but in some other profession (finance, say, or graphic design). You aren't drawing a salary for your programming per se, but if you write scripts to help you do things in that profession, then you too are a programmer.

If you are just taking some online coding course, but doing your homework, then you are a programmer. A fledgling programmer, but a programmer nonetheless.

### You are a programmer if you are programming, period.

Zed Shaw [expresses it well here](http://goo.gl/US8Xcf), with his trademark subtlety and tact.

So -- just start building stuff! Don't worry too much about whether some star chamber of judgmental nerds (e.g., a hiring committee somewhere) would consider you to be "real" or "worthy" not. Just put yourself out there and make things, even if it's just tiny stuff at first, even if it's embarrassingly crudely assembled, even if you feel like you have no idea what you are doing.

And on that note, as always, if you want support or inspiration, just [hit me up](/about).
