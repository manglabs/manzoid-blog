I have mentored quite a few people, over the years, in learning how to code. It's a happy hobby of mine. I've been helped by many people over the years and I am glad to "pay it forward", as they say.

But one glaring thing I have noticed is that people often can't really articulate *why* they want to learn to code. In itself, that'd be fine, but *then*, usually just a few weeks or even a few *days* in, they crap out. They just plain, old-fashioned throw in the towel.

Despite a fair amount of encouragement, wheedling, cajoling, and prodding on my part, they just drift back to ogling [Daenerys Targaryen][1], not having progressed much further along the path.

I feel that this comes about in part because we didn't really get to the bottom of what their real motivations were,

Now, I'm not necessarily advocating doing some big "couch session" before simply diving in and doing stuff. Far from it. Just doing stuff is great! But at the same time, it's no surprise to anyone that learning to code well enough to actually do anything real is pretty hard. It's so hard that people quit in droves. So as partial inoculation against *chronic giveupitis*, I think it's a good idea to take a little time to sort through your motivations.

Being clearer about why you're doing something can help you stick with it. Biological organisms are generally inherently energy-conserving. If something really doesn't make sense to your brain, and you're just forcing yourself to do it anyway, some deep parts of you are going to say screwwwwww this… and trigger a hundred insidious rationalizations at the conscious level for giving up.

With that in mind, take a look at this laundry list that fell out of the top of my head just now. I'm sure there are many more reasons than this that people could come up with, but hopefully some items in this initial list will resonate with you and help you articulate why you're in the game -- and hopefully, by extension, why you're in it to win it!

    * that makes good money
    * with good future prospects

## How about you?

So… assuming you consider yourself to be a learner or at least a “Zen beginner’s mind” type of person still… does any of this resonate with you?

What floats your personal boat?

Anything to add to the list?
