There's a [lot of interest](http://goo.gl/1jZlIZ) in "[coding academy](http://goo.gl/OoG61o)" camps .  The basic story is that you are fed up with your current job and want to make a career switch into programming. In theory, you could self-study and bootstrap yourself into this new career, but it's too slow going that way, and you'd like to fast-track your learning.

That's where the coding academies come in. They typically take from 9 to 12 weeks, and are intense, full-immersion "boot camp"-style experiences. You learn programming basics, a bunch of tools, and build multiple applications that will then go into your portfolio upon graduation. Toward the end of the program, you also typically get varying degrees of placement help to get you into your first professional job, as a junior software developer. Starting salaries in major metropolitan areas tend to head north of $80k right now, apparently.

The tuition seems to average around $11,000 or so. This is definitely pricey, but compared to the cost of getting a regular degree, it's not outrageously high. Also you can factor in the fact that the programs are comparatively short -- 3 months or so -- and therefore the opportunity cost of lost income in the meantime will be significantly lower than a more conventional and slower-paced program.

It's a fair chunk of change, though.  To partially address that, some programs will reimburse a portion of the tuition if you choose to go with a company that they introduce you to. This reimbursement is of course funded by a hefty recruiting fee that is paid by that company to the bootcamp organizers.

One of the programs, [http://www.appacademy.io/](http://www.appacademy.io/), has a surprising twist on the model. They don't actually charge up front. Rather, tuition is free during the program itself, and they make their money by securing a percentage of the annual salary upon placement (18% as of this writing). If you don't find a job, you don't have to pay for the training. This is a bit eyebrow-raising, but it seems to be working, at least for now. They self-report their current placement stats as:

> 95% of our graduates have offers or are working in tech jobs now at an average salary of $91,000.

Also there are some programs that offer discounts for under-represented classes of students, especially women. There's even a program that is women-only (HackBright).

A bunch of people I know are actively looking into these coding camps. Since so many people were talking about them, I started looking around and found a surprising number of them had launched, so I thought I'd just dump a quick list of them here. If you know of any more, please let me know, and I'll tack 'em on.
